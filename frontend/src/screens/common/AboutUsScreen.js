            <h3>About Us : </h3>
            <p>Launched in 2022, Our technology platform connects customers, 
                restaurant partners and delivery partners, serving their multiple needs. 
                Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, 
                order food delivery and make payments to restaurants. 
                On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with 
                industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire 
                customers to grow their business while also providing a reliable and 
                efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop procurement 
                solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen 
                products to restaurant partners. We also provide our delivery partners with 
                transparent and flexible earning opportunities.
